# Driver Tracker

In this Repository, we’re building a car location tracking app like Careem and Uber. 
Although we’re not developing complete apps like Uber and Careem. But we’ll see how to online a driver and show the online driver in the passenger app and update the driver whenever its current location changed.

For online and offline the driver we’re going to use the Firebase Real-time Database. The driver simply sends its current location to the firebase and passenger see the driver on the Google Map.

Driver Traker is an example app that showcases using 
[Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key),
[Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
